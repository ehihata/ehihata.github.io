### CPSC 120

* Lab 9 https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-09b-matt-frida-and-eric
  Lab 9 part 2 was a favorite because I was always liked the idea of creating a game all   from scratch.
    
* lab 10 https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-10-eric
 lab 10 part 1 was also my favorite becuase creating an algorithm to check the populations of countries is a really interesting concept that can be actaully used in the real world.

* lab 8 https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-08-eric-and-marc Lab 8 part 1 is a fun lab where we learn how to take the aberage of numbers and judges scores, this application can be used in real life as well and it very useful for competitions.
