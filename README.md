### CPSC 120

* Lab 9 https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-09b-matt-frida-and-eric
  Lab 9 part 2 was a favorite because I was always liked the idea of creating a game all   from scratch.
    
* lab 10 https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-10-eric
 lab 10 part 1 was also my favorite becuase creating an algorithm to check the populations of countries is a really interesting concept that can be actaully used in the real world.
